--  File Name:
--      yearly-comparison-of-sales-growth-by-country.sql

--  Keywords:
--      Country, Comparison by Year, Sales Growth

--  Description:
--      Compare annual sales growth by country

--  Insights:
--      There is an increase in tracks sold to customers in Argentina and Canada,
--      while there is a decrease in tracks sold to customers from the United States and Germany.

--      Out of the above 4 countries, the majority of Rolling Music Storeâ€™s business
--      is done with customers from the United States.

--  Recommendations:
--      Rolling Music Store should collect feedback from their customers in
--      these 4 countries to understand their flaws and strengths.

--      If sales growth in Argentina (for example) is consistent,
--      Jackson Sam should consider setting up a local retail store in Argentina.

--      He should perhaps give exclusive benefits to their United States customers,
--      such as free shipping for deliveries.
--      This rewards United States customers collectively for their high sales revenue
--      and encourages sales growth, all while avoiding any potential bias among their customers.

--      For the United States and Germany, they should research on the more
--      popular artists/genres in those countries, and investigate possible causes
--      for the drop in sales, such as unreasonable track pricing or lack of promotional reach.

--  Parameters:
--      @custom_min_year:   Select earlier year to compare against (default is earliest year)
--      @custom_max_year:   Select later year to compare (default is latest year)
