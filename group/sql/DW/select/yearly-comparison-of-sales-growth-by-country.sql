--  File Name:
--      yearly-comparison-of-sales-growth-by-country.sql

--  Keywords:
--      Country, Comparison by Year, Sales Growth

--  Description:
--      --

--  Insights:
--      There is an increase in tracks sold to customers in Argentina and Canada.
--      While there is a decrease in tracks sold to
--      customers in the United States and Germany.
--      Out of the 4 countries, the majority of Rolling Music Storeâ€™s
--      business is done with customers from the United States.

--  Recommendations:
--      Rolling Music Store should collect feedback from their customers
--      in these 4 countries to understand their flaws and strengths.
--      To improve customer loyalty in Argentina and Canada,
--      they should offer a small gift, such as vouchers,
--      to customers and express their gratitude.

--      For the United States and Germany, they should research on the
--      more popular artists in those countries, and investigate possible
--      causes for the drop in sales, such as overly-priced tracks.

--  Parameters:
--      @custom_min_year:   Select earlier year to compare against (default is earliest year)
--      @custom_max_year:   Select later year to compare (default is latest year)
