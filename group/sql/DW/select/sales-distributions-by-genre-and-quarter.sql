--  File Name:
--      sales-distributions-by-genre-and-quarter.sql

--  Keywords:
--      Sales Distribution, Variation, Genre, Quarter

--  Description:
--      --

--  Insights:
--      Classical, “Sci Fi & Fantasy” and “R&B/Soul” genres
--      have the highest variation across the 4 quarters.
--      Classical had the highest sales in the 2nd and 4th quarters.
--      “Sci Fi & Fantasy” had the highest sales in the 2nd quarter.
--      “R&B/Soul” had the highest sales in the 3rd quarter.
--      Latin, Rock and Soundtrack genres have the lowest variation across
--      the 4 quarters, which implies that the sales are more consistent.

--  Recommendations:
--      Rolling Music Store should stock up on tracks from the
--          -   Classical and “Sci Fi & Fantasy” genres in the 2nd quarter
--          -   “R&B/Soul” genre in the 3rd quarter
--          -   Classical in the 4th quarter
--      To ensure that there will be sufficient stocks to reduce loss of sales due to out of stock.

--  Parameters:
--      @prefix:        Customize prefix for each quarter's label (default is 'Proportion (Q')
--      @postfix:       Customize postfix for each quarter's label (default is ')')
--      @top_count:     Select how many high-variability genres to view (default is 3)
--      @bottom_count:  Select how many low-variability genres to view (default is 3)
